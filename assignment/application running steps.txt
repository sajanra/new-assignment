
Running steps of the application : 
----------------------------------

	Open terminal or command propmt.
	And in terminal go at your activemq bin directory. 
	And here execute 'activemq start' command for terminal and 'activemq.bat start' command for command propmt.
	After then activemq will be start and you can check at http://localhost:8161/admin url (By default,ActiveMQ Web Console will be available here)
	When you hit http://localhost:8161/admin url then a propmt will open and ask for credentials.
	For see the activemq console you have to insert Username: admin and Password: admin , this is default credentials.

	After then run your java application by main class.


Working of the classes :
---------------------------------------

ProducerConsumerApp.java : 

	This java class is a main class which is loads the broker URL (default broker url is tcp://localhost:61616) and queue name
	from a properties file.
	And initializes a MessageQueue instance with the broker URL and queue name.
	ProducerConsumerApp clas uses ExecutorService to start the Producer and Consumer.
	
	
Producer.java : 
	
	Producer class connects to the ActiveMQ broker and starts sending messages to the queue.

	This class sends number of text messages (as configured) and logs each sent messages.
	and also updates the Tracker to increment the success count for each successful message.
	If an error occurs, the Tracker increments the failure count.
	
	
Consumer.java : 
 
	Consumer class connects to the ActiveMQ broker and starts consuming messages from the queue.
	and also logs each received message.
	
	
Tracker.java :

	Tracker class logs the total number of successful and failed messages when the application shuts down.

	In this application there is also two properties files first config.properties file for store the properties.
	and second is logging.properties file for store the messages and exception in a log file.
